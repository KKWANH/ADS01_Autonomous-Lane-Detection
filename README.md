> "Autonomous Lane Detection with PiRacer: A Hands-On Approach to Self-Driving Vehicles" is a peer-to-peer educational project aimed at introducing students and hobbyists to the exciting world of autonomous vehicles. The project focuses on using the Raspberry Pi and various sensors and actuators to build a low-cost yet powerful autonomous vehicle. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how a simple computer like the Raspberry Pi can be used to develop an autonomous vehicle that can detect lanes and maintain its position within them. With a hands-on approach, participants will learn about the fundamentals of autonomous vehicles and gain practical experience in building one themselves. Join us on this journey to discover the future of self-driving technology.
